#In this program, we will be finding the area of a triangle. In order to find
#the area, we must use the formula area=1/2*base*height.

#First, we will assign a value to our variables Base and Height. We will keep
#these variable names simple and descriptive by naming them "base" and "height"

#assign the value 12 to the variable "base"
base=12
#assign the value 16 to the variable "height"
height=16

#Next we need to assign our formula to calculate the area. We will, again, keep
#this name simple and descriptive by naming it "area".
area=1/2*base*height
#Now we will tell python to print the "area" which will calculate our formula
#12*16 and then divide that in half, giving us our value. 
print(area)
